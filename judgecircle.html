        //There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. 
        // Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after 
        // it completes its moves.

        // The move sequence is represented by a string, and the character moves[i] 
        // represents its ith move. Valid moves are R (right), L (left), U (up), and D (down). 
        // If the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, return true. 
        // Otherwise, return false.

        // Note: The way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. "R" will always make 
        // the robot move to the right once, "L" will always make it move left, etc. 
        // Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.
